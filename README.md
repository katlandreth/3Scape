#Installation/Setup with Node 
 1. Install Node.js
    * Go to the [Node](http://nodejs.org) website to install node.js

 2. Install MongoDB
    * Go to the [MongoDB](http://mongodb.org) website and install MongoDB
 
 3. Setting up the environment
    * First run MongoDB by opening your command prompt and going to the bin file.
      The default for Windows would be "C:\Program Files\MongoDB 2.6 Standard\bin"
    * Run the command mongod.exe to start the mongo database 
    *Now open a second command prompt (in Git Shell preferably) and go to the directory where 3Scape is located. 
     Enter the command node server.js
    *You should see "the magic happens on port `port`. In your browser and type in `hostname`/`port` and voila!

    Note: You need the Mongo command prompt to be on at all times when working on 3Scape
